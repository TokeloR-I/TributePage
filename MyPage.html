      <h3>Tale of the Magi</h3>
      <p>Aleister Crowley was an influential occultist, mystic, alchemist, writer, poet, painter, mountaineer, and ceremony magician.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Birth 1875</b> Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875</li>
      <li><b>Cambridge University: 1895–1898</b> Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was entered for the Moral Science Tripos studying philosophy.</li>
      <li><b>The Golden Dawn: 1898–99</b>  Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group's leader, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn's Isis-Urania Temple held at London's Mark Masons Hall, where Crowley took the magical motto and name "Frater Perdurabo", which he interpreted as "I shall endure to the end".</li>
      <li><b>Egypt and The Book of the Law: 1904</b> Had! The manifestation of Nuit.The unveiling of the company of heaven.Every man and every woman is a star.Every number is infinite; there is no difference.  Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!The opening lines of The Book of the Law In February 1904, Crowley and Rose arrived in Cairo. Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic. According to Crowley's later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him "they are waiting for you." On 18 March, she explained that "they" were the god Horus </li>
      <li><b>Kanchenjunga and China: 1905–06</b> Returning to Boleskine,Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops from a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife.He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious</li>
      <li><b>The ∴A∴A∴ and The Holy Books of Thelema: 1907–1909</b>With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley continued performing the Abramelin rituals at the Ashdown Park Hotel in Coulsdon, Surrey. Crowley claimed that in doing so he attained samadhi, or union with Godhead, thereby marking a turning point in his life.Making heavy use of hashish during these rituals, he wrote an essay on "The Psychology of Hashish" (1909) in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism.He also claimed to have been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907, adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him, "Liber VII" and "Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente", both of which were later classified in the corpus of The Holy Books of Thelema</li>
      
      <li><b>Died 1947</b> 1 December 1947, Crowley died at Netherwood of chronic bronchitis aggravated by pleurisy and myocardial degeneration, aged 72.</li>
